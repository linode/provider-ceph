  # Upon a merge to main, this job checks out main and updates package/crossplane.yaml
  # and README.md to point to the latest version (latest git commit SHA). This version
  # is then used to create and publish a new package to the Upbound marketplace. Finally,
  # using our updated branch an automated PR is opened against main with the version changes.
