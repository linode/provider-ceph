# provider-ceph

`provider-ceph` is a minimal [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider
that reconciles `Bucket` CRs with multiple external S3 backends such as Ceph. It comes
with the following features:

- A `ProviderConfig` type that represents a single S3 backend (such as Ceph) and points to a credentials `Secret` for access to that backend.
- A controller that reconciles `ProviderConfig` objects which represent S3 backends and stores client details for each backend.
- A `Bucket` resource type that represents an S3 bucket.
- A controller that observes `Bucket` objects and reconciles these objects with the S3 backends.

## Developing
Spin up the test environment, but with `provider-ceph` running locally in your terminal:

```
make dev
```

After you've made some changes, kill (Ctrl+C) the existing `provider-ceph` and re-run it:

```
make run
```

## Getting Started

[Install Crossplane](https://docs.crossplane.io/v1.11/software/install/#install-crossplane) in you Kubernetes cluster

Install the provider by using the Upbound CLI after changing the image tag to the latest release:

```
up ctp provider install xpkg.upbound.io/linode/provider-ceph:v0.0.39
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: linode-provider-ceph
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/linode/provider-ceph:v0.0.39
